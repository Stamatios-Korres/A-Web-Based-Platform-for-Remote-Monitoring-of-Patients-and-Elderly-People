#   A Web-Based Platform for Remote Monitoring of Patients and Elderly People

This repository contains the code for my Thesis and the paper "A low-cost IoT-based health monitoring platform enriched with social networking facilities". The application is splitted into two parts:

* The patient access point [Raspberry-Application](https://gitlab.com/timos/Cloud-Webrtc/tree/master/raspberry), responsible for their everyday activities, health-monitoring and acess to a dedicated social network.
* The doctor/relatives access point [Server-Application](https://gitlab.com/timos/Cloud-Webrtc/tree/master/Cloud-Webrtc), through which people related with the patient can communicate with him/her, check his health-condition (biosignal history, real-time health measurements, video calls).
